<!-- -->[The Beatitudes] are very well known, often being cited as favourite texts, and yet there are some serious puzzles that they present us with. Why are there nine, with the last one seemingly tagged on at the end? Why is there a mixture of future and present tenses in the sayings? Why is one of the promises (about the kingdom of heaven) repeated—did Jesus run out of other good things to say? Are they encouragements under pressure, or commendations of virtue? More to the point, are they realistic, or are they (with the rest of the ‘Sermon on the Mount’) setting out an unattainable ideal?</p>

<em>Neruda, I'm sorry, but as a woman I can't read the excerpt below (<a href="https://spanishpoems.blogspot.com/2005/02/pablo-neruda-epitalamio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the original poem is quite long!</a>) and not think about biological motherhood; about the tenderness, frailty and beauty that lies in bringing life forth in the womb. As a matter of fact, I was disappointed when the poem revealed itself as a romantic one. Of course I didn't know the meaning of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithalamium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epithalamium</a> until then, much less that the poem was part of <strong>that</strong> book, but who cares for such minor details?</em></p>
<p><em>So sorry, not sorry. To me, this is and always will be a motherhood poem. So here goes the version that would come to life were I your editor. Would have to re-think the title, though. :D</em></p>

<p>Beyond the bend in the road<br>
<!-- -->There may be a well, and there may be a castle,<br>
<!-- -->And there may be just more road.<br>
<!-- -->I don’t know and don’t ask.<br>
<!-- -->As long as I’m on the road that’s before the bend<br>
<!-- -->I look only at the road before the bend,<br>
<!-- -->Because the road before the bend is all I can see.<br>
<!-- -->It would do me no good to look anywhere else<br>
<!-- -->Or at what I can’t see.<br>
<!-- -->Let’s pay attention only to where we are.<br>
<!-- -->There’s only enough beauty in being here and not somewhere else.<br>
<!-- -->If there are people beyond the bend in the road,<br>
<!-- -->Let them worry about what’s beyond the bend in the road.<br>
<!-- -->That, for them, is the road.<br>
<!-- -->If we’re to arrive there, when we arrive there we’ll know.<br>
<!-- -->For now we know only that we’re not there.<br>
<!-- -->Here there’s just the road before the bend, and before the bend<br>
<!-- -->There’s the road without any bend.</p>
